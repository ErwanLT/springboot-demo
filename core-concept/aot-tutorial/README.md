# AOT Compilation Tutorial

This module demonstrates how to use Spring Boot's Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation feature to create a native executable.

## How to run

To build a native image, run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean package -Pnative
```

This will create a native executable in the `target` directory.
